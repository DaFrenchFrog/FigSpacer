I did this plugin for my own use so it's given "as is" ! Don't hesitate to improve I will do my best to upadte the repo asap !

# How to install on Figma

- Download the .zip file [here](https://github.com/DaFrenchFrog/FigSpacer/blob/main/public/plugin%20spacer.zip) and uncompress it in a temp folder.
- In Figma go to Plugins -> Development -> Import plugin from manifest...
- Select the manifest.json file
- You're all set ! To show the window go to Plugins -> Development -> DaFrenchFrog

# Known issues

- The plugin only look for every component with "тне" or "тнд" in its name, and switch the correct opactity according to the checkbox state. So depending on the last state of the plugin (or the last state in the design), you will click the checkbox and nothing moves. You will have to click twice to see the changes
- Also for slow computer the changes might take time if you have many components in the design. I had a Mid-2014 Macbook Pro and things were quite slow but with a M1 Macbook things are ok for my use...



# Figsvelte

This plugin uses FigSvelte, a boilerplate for creating Figma plugins using Svelte.

This starter project has everything you need to start developing a Figma plugin usign Svelte. Your JS, CSS, SVG and image assets can be bundled on build. The package will take care of compiling your typescript + app on save during development, and also minify on build.

Additionally, this package comes preconfigured with [Figma Plugin DS Svelte](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds-svelte) where you have access to a large range of components and icons that match the Figma UI, to get you up and running quickly. Note: installing this boilerplate will install the component library as a dependency.

Only what you import/use will be included in the final build for small bundle size.

## To get started

```bash
npx degit thomas-lowry/figsvelte figma-plugin
cd figma-plugin
npm install
```

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed._

## Connecting your plugin to Figma

Connecting your plugin to Figma
After installing, go to **Plugins / Development / New Plugin** in the Figma desktop app for Mac OS or Windows and choose the option **"Link existing plugin"**.

_You also can just type "New Plugin" in Figma global search to go there_

From there you need to link a **manifest.json** file located at **public** folder in your directory:

```bash
/figma-plugin/public/manifest.json
```

Now edit this file to give a new name for your plugin, and you will be able call it from Figma: **Plugins / Development / Your Plugin Name**

## Development

During development, watch your project for changes with the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start building your plugin UI in `'src/Plugin.svelte'`.

## Build

When ready to package up your final Figma Plugin:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Useful info

To include an external CSS file:

```javascript
import styles from "./styles.css";
```

To include an SVG:

```javascript
import SvgName from './image.svg';

//use in your markup
{@html SvgName}
```

_For more info on using the Icon component system with SVGs from [Figma Plugin DS Svelte](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds-svelte), refer to the repo._
